# sclqcHamil-sim

This repository contains code and datasets for generating images presented in the paper titled *Scalable quantum circuits for exponential of Pauli strings and Hamiltonian simulations*. The code is organized into multiple folders, each designed to produce specific plots.

## Repository Structure
- Each folder contains:
  - The dataset used for generating the plots (e.g., `.txt` or `.npz`).
  - The corresponding Python script to create the plot (e.g., `.py`).
  - The generated output image (e.g., `.png`).

## Data Availability
All other datasets and detailed information required for a complete understanding of the research can be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
